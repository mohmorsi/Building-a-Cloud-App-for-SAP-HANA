## Introduction
SAP HANA is an in-memory database that is high perfomance and speeds up data driven actions and decisons. In this project I will deploy, a 3-layered GCloud application, where all the layers connected to each other. The databse access layer is a Node.js application and will retrieve data from SAP HANA. A Backend application, in Go, that translates the records from the database. A frontend application that triggers the translation and exposes the database records.
