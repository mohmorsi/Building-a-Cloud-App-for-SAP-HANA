## Introduction
SAP HANA is an in-memory database that is high perfomance and speeds up data driven actions and decisons. In this project I will deploy, a 3-layered interconnected GCloud application. A databse access layer that retrieves data from SAP HANA, a backend application that translates the records from the database using GCloud's Translation API, and a frontend application that triggers the translation and exposes the database records..
